Welcome to Happy Bee's Cafe!

This documentation covers the interactive front-end web application for a cafe based in Halifax, West Yorkshire. It is built entirely with HTML5 and CSS3 for educational purposes, with permission and zero compensation.

Throught development of the project, I bore in mind my principles of CARE:

- Cohesive
- Accessible
- Responsive
- Essential

We will discover how these guiding principles formed the basis of my first web application project to create an appealing, logical and valuable product.

By the end of this document, we will have covered:

- UX (User Experience) development
- Testing of the application throughout development, implementation and deployment stages
- Deployment method to a cloud-based platform (GitHub Pages)
- Code structure and organization to maximize maintainability for the future
- Version control process
- Development learning opportunities and ideas for future implementations
